🧠 Overview

AdSphere Kenya reimagines the traditional online marketplace.Think OLX or Jiji Kenya, but in 3D — where ads come alive with smooth animations, interactive product previews, and cinematic scrolling experiences.

The platform merges motion design, 3D environments, and commerce, giving users a new way to explore, showcase, and interact with ads.
